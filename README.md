# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose:
- The purpose of this module is to 
•	Create a branch from the main branch on GitHub.
•	Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.
•	Merge a branch with the main branch on GitHub.
•	Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
•	Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
•	Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
•	Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
•	Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
•	Render maps on a local server.
## Results: 
- The data that were used in this challenge of Deliverable 1 was 
 GitHub repository Links to an external site. 
- In deliverable 2: M4.5+ EarthquakesLinks to an external site. 
 Using these links the map was created with overlays and different controls.

## Summary:
- Map view with all the controls and different layers with check/uncheck box
